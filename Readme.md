This is a python django project for restaurant. I wanted to implement authentication but the problem statement says that it should be for restaurant owner only and not for the staff. This is a little bit confusing because it is also said that owner should be able to add products through Django admin.
So point is if owner is able to add through django admin then that could be done through superuser. How can I provide authentication on that. Also, I have registered the m,odels in admin for owner to add data.
But if needed I know how to apply authentication, If time would have been there I could have implemented on customer.

It's been long that I have not made frontend in Django, I used to do it while learning in my initial days. But if time would have been there then I could have created a seperate frontend application for the same.
As the frontend is not made. So I am attaching the screenshots of APIs.
